# UX/UI Improvements Applied

## Date: October 24, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ❌ Poor Button Contrast
**Problem:** Buttons had weak colors that were hard to see against backgrounds

**Solution:**
- Increased button padding: `px-6 py-3` (from `px-4 py-2`)
- Made font bolder: `font-semibold`
- Added drop shadow: `shadow-md`
- Improved focus rings: `focus:ring-4` with better colors
- Enhanced hover states with darker shades
- Better disabled state styling with clear opacity and cursor changes

### 2. ❌ Revealing Correct Answers Too Early
**Problem:** After clicking submit, the app was showing correct/incorrect answers immediately, which was confusing and felt broken

**Solution:**
- **Removed answer reveal logic** - Now options just become disabled after submission
- Added `useEffect` to reset component state when question changes
- Changed "Submitting..." text to "Moving to next question..." for clarity
- Options now show gray/disabled state after submit, not green/red

### 3. ❌ Weak Visual Feedback
**Problem:** Selected options were hard to distinguish

**Solution:**
- **Selected state:** Strong blue border (`border-blue-600`), blue background (`bg-blue-100`), bold text
- **Unselected state:** Clear border (`border-gray-300`), white background, hover effects
- **Option letters:** Dynamic styling - blue background with white text when selected
- Larger letter circles: `w-10 h-10` (from `w-8 h-8`)
- Better text sizing and spacing

### 4. ❌ Inconsistent Typography
**Problem:** Text sizes and weights were inconsistent

**Solution:**
- Made all buttons consistently sized and weighted
- Improved submit button: `text-lg font-semibold px-8 py-3`
- Better label text with proper font weights
- Consistent color usage throughout

### 5. ❌ Poor Input Field Contrast
**Problem:** Input fields were hard to see

**Solution:**
- Increased border width: `border-2` (from `border`)
- Darker focus border: `focus:border-blue-600`
- Added text styling: `text-gray-900 font-medium`
